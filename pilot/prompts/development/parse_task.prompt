Ok, now, take your previous message and convert it to actionable items. An item might be a code change or a command run. When you need to change code, use "save_file" for new files or changing smaller files (less than 100 lines). For larger files (more than 100 lines of code), where you only need to change a few lines, use "modify_file" instead. For "modify_file", if the previous message provided example code snippets to explain the change, include them - provide as much context as possible.

The commands must be able to run on a {{ os }} machine.

**IMPORTANT**
Within the file modifications, anything needs to be written by the user, add the comment in the same line as the code that starts with `// INPUT_REQUIRED {input_description}` where `input_description` is a description of what needs to be added here by the user. Just make sure that you put comments only inside files that support comments (e.g. not in JSON files),
and only if the user input is really required for the code to get working. If the user input is not required, just add the code without the comment.
